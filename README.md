# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of programming challenges that were released once a day btw Dec. 1st and Dec. 25th 2015.

My solutions written in **Groovy** to the puzzles can be found on [this polyglot repository](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/Advent-Of-Code-Polyglot/tree/master/groovy).
